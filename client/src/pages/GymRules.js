            <strong>Keep up the Personal Hygiene</strong>
            <br/>
            MMA is a contact sport, and it's important that everyone maintains a high standard of cleanliness to prevent the spread of serious illness and disease, as well as preventing physical harm - this allows for a greater focus on quality training!
            <ul>
              <li>Self hygiene - make sure your gym clothes are clean and that you've showered recently before attending class. Trim your nails short.</li>
              <li>Kids must remain supervised before and after their classes. No youth members are allowed in the Gym / Weights area unattended.Clean up after yourself. If you are dripping sweat, bring a towel and where neccessary a change of training clothes. Spray down your workspace and any equipment used at the end of your workout.</li>
              <li>Cuts and bruises must be thoroughly cleaned and covered.</li>
              <li>No training with any form of sickness or contagious diseases. If any form of transferrable illness is suspected, the coaches and admin team have the right to ask the member to refrain from training until a doctors clearance certificate can be produced.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <strong>Be a good training partner</strong>
            <br/>
            Martial arts are solo sports in competition, but team sports in the gym. We're all here to learn, help and build off each other - that's what helps us improve and maintain a competitive advantage. However, this sometimes requires a few pointers:
            <br/>
            <ul>
              <li>Leave your ego at the door - we're all here to learn.</li>
              <li>Be coachable - it's what you're paying your fees for. Try to understand the purpose of each drill and make sure you're upholding your part (i.e. dont go mental with intensity on a flow drill, or drift away when you're supposed to be an active training partner). Observe the technique with full focus.</li>
              <li>Let the coaches do the coaching - it's what they are there for. Helping your partner to understand the drill or breaking down movement is fine, but make sure it's in line with the class at hand.</li>
              <li>Show up on time so you don't miss key points at the start of the class - and warm up properly. Similarly, don't slink off early and skip your role on the receiving end.</li>
              <li>Keep it technical day-to-day. Large amounts of hard physical training can result in injury - so the coaches will be deliberately be cycling and moderating this throughout the week.</li>
              <li>Don't waste time in between drills and moving around on the mat. Partner up quickly, line up quickly. Avoid unneccessary distractions and keep a drink bottle close to the mat for quick drink breaks.</li>
              <li>Be patient and stick it out. Everyone starts as a white belt.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
