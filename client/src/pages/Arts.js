            The founder of Karate Kyokushinkai – Sosai Masutatsu Oyama – was born on the 27th of July, 1923, in a village in South Korea. At the age of 9, while staying at his sister’s farm in Mandjuriya, he started training in Chinese Kenpo and more particular “The Eighteen Hands” form. In 1938, Oyama left for Japan with the intention to enroll in an aviation school to become a jet pilot, but he had to give up on his dream. He continued to practice Judo and box, and his interest in martial arts led him to the dojo of Gichin Funakoshi, where he started practicing Okinawa Karate.

            <br/>
            Sosai Masutatsu Oyama – Founder of Kyokushin Karate Oyama advanced quickly due to his great dedication. He was only 20 years old when he achieved the rank of 4th Dan. In the same period of time, Oyama enrolled in the Japanese Imperial Army and started practicing Judo in order to master its hand grip techniques. In four years, he achieved the rank of 4th Dan in Judo and ended up its training.

            <br/>
            After the Japanese defeat in Second World War, Oyama, as any young Japanese, relapsed into personal anguish. He managed to find a way out of his despair while training with So Nei Chu, a Korean master in Goju-Ryu Karate. This great teacher famous for the strength of his body as well as for his deep spirituality had a great impact on the young Mas Oyama. Master So taught him the inhesion of BUDO and the spiritual foundations of Buddhism. After some years of traning, Master So advised Mas Oyama to make a vow to dedicate his life to the Warrior’s Way, and to seclude himself into the mountains, to train his mind and body.

            <br/>
            In October 1946, Oyama began exercising in isolation in the Minobu Mountain. Only two months later, he was forced to return to civilization due to the lack of supplies.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In September 1947, he won unreservedly the All-Japan Open Karate Championship. However, this for him was not enough, and in 1948 Mas Oyama withdrew into the Kiosumi Mountain, in Chiba prefecture. He was followed by another trainee – Yashiro. The friend/sponsor Mr. Kayama supplied them with food every month. Through vigorous training, Mas Oyama learned to overcome the anxiety caused by the solitude, but Yashiro was unable to do this. After 6 months, he escaped, leaving Oyama alone. Eighteen months later, Mr. Kayma informed Masutatsu Oyama that, due to unexpected circumstances, he could no longer support the food provisions for his isolation in the mountains. As a result, Oyama’s original plan to remain cut off for three years was untimely interrupted.

            <br/>
            After returning from his isolation, Oyama won again the All-Japan Open Karate Championship. His success was followed by many victories in different martial championships and tournaments with dissimilar rules and regulations. Many times, he challenged to fight without rules masters from different martial arts, but they all ended up with a clear-cut win by Oyama. In this way, he practiced and perfected his Karate.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Masutatsu Oyama opened his first dojo in 1953 in Meijiro, Tokyo. This was the time when the strength of Mas Oyama was in its highest point, and the trainings in the dojo were ruthless. Many of his apprentices were members of different martial arts, and Oyama compared their styles and forms with his Karate. He adopted the best techniques and concepts and incorporated them in his trainings. In this way, he set up the foundations of Kyokushin Karate. The formation of the world organization began in 1960, and it was officially open in July, 1965. It was named the International Karate Organization (IKO). It was at this time when Oyama introduced the name for his style in karate – Kyokushin (the ultimate truth) – and began spreading it all over the world, creating one of the biggest martial arts organizations on the planet. Because of his contribution to the development of karate, Oyama was awarded the honored title “Sosai”.

            <br/>
            Kyokushin Karate proved to be the hardest and most aggressive style in karate. Many of its disciples became champions in fights with different rulings. Kyokushin fighters were noted for their exceptional strength and high fighting spirit. This raised the authority of the style and won its recognition in the martial arts circles.

            The word “jiu jitsu” derives from the Japanese “Jū” meaning “gentle” and “Jutsu” meaning “art”; essentially, jiu jitsu is the “gentle art”. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a predominantly ground-based martial art, using the principals of leverage, angles, pressure and timing, as well as knowledge of the human anatomy, in order to achieve a non-violent submission of one’s opponent. Unlike other martial arts that focus on strikes and/or kicks, jiu jitsu focuses on close-contact “grappling” holds and techniques, and the application of chokes and joint-manipulations.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Brazilian style of jiu jitsu resulted from the import of Japanese jiu jitsu and judo to the South American continent in the early 1900s, and its transformation into a new martial art style by a core group of Brazilian pioneers.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            Before it arrived to the shores of Brazil, however, the origins of jiu jitsu are believed to go back thousands of years. There are several theories concerning its very first beginnings, but many agree that it can at least be traced back 4,000 years ago, to Buddhist monks in India, who needed to protect themselves during their travels without inflicting harm on their attackers. It then spread to feudal Japan, where it developed into an effective hand-to-hand combat during war, before transitioning to become more of an art form and a competitive activity. Some even argue for much older origins than India, dating back to the earliest forms of “grappling”, which are immortalized on the walls of ancient Greek and Egyptian ruins.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            Then in 1915, a world famous Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda, arrived to Brazil, where he soon began teaching and giving demonstrations in jiu jitsu and judo, which at the time were not seen as separate disciplines. Three of Maeda’s first students went on to become the founders of what is known as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: brothers Carlos and Helio Gracie, and Luiz França. Each of these early pioneers contributed to the development of what is today known as Brazilian jiu jitsu, by maximizing the effectiveness of existing techniques, creating new ones, and giving rise to a distinct martial art.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            It wasn’t long before the Brazilian style of jiu jitsu started to spread to other countries and continents. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu arrived to the United States in the early 1970s, but grew relatively slowly until the 1990s, when the UFC brought mixed martial arts – and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu – to the mainstream public. In 2002, Carlos Gracie, Jr. founded the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation, which began holding organized jiu jitsu competitions world-wide. In the last decade, jiu jitsu has boomed, and today, many of the world’s largest and most prestigious tournaments are held in the United States.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            All Brazilian jiu jitsu practitioners can trace their “lineage” back to one of the founding members. Professor JT’s lineage can be traced back to Carlos and Helio Gracie.            <br/>
            <br/>
            More than just a workout, jiu jitsu is often referred to as “human chess” in that it exercises both the body and the mind.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            The physical benefits of jiu jitsu are immense and well-documented. Because jiu jitsu presents a combination of dynamic and explosive movements with pressure-based isometric pushing, pulling, and holding, it helps to develop increased strength and cardio, as well as promotes weight loss and improved muscle tone. Because you’re constantly responding to another person’s movements, jiu jitsu also heightens your body awareness and improves your balance and reactive ability.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            Jiu jitsu is also an incredible mental workout. For one, it provides the challenge of learning a new activity, with limitless variations of movements, techniques and submissions. It also develops your reasoning skills, in that you are constantly planning your next step, both when you’re in an advantageous position or a defensive position. As an activity practiced with another person, it increases your ability think quickly and “on your feet” in response to your partner’s movements, as well as to remain calm and controlled when you find yourself in a defensive situation.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            For many, it also provides an outlet for the stresses of daily life. When you step on the mat, everything else is put to the side for a moment, while both your mind and body are engaged in learning jiu jitsu.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            Most importantly, unlike many other sports and physical activities, jiu jitsu is unique in that it can be done by anyone. Jiu Jitsu was designed and developed so that a smaller, weaker person can defend his or herself against, or even defeat, a larger and stronger opponent. So regardless of age, size, gender or physical limitation, any person can utilize the techniques and principals of jiu jitsu, and reap the benefits of its practice.            <br/>
